# Code Transformers

The transformation logic is split into specialized transformers found in `src/transpiler/transformers/`.

## WrapperTransformer
Ensures the user code is wrapped in a standard context function:
```javascript
(context) => {
    // user code
}
```

## NormalizationTransformer
Prevents users from aliasing standard Pine Script symbols in import destructuring. This ensures the transpiler can reliably identify standard variables like `close` or `ta`.

## InjectionTransformer
Scans for usage of standard variables (like `close`, `open`) and injects the necessary destructuring statements if they are missing:
```javascript
const { close, open } = context.data;
```

## MainTransformer & StatementTransformer
These handle the bulk of the logic:

*   **Variable Declaration**: Transforms `let x = ...` into `$.let.scope_x = $.init(...)`.
*   **Assignment**: Transforms `x = ...` into `$.set($.let.scope_x, ...)`.
*   **Array Access**: Transforms `x[1]` into `$.get($.let.scope_x, 1)`.
*   **Loops/Conditionals**: Ensures scoping rules are respected within blocks.

## ExpressionTransformer
Handles expressions, primarily function calls and binary operations.

*   **Function Calls**: Injects `param()` wrappers around arguments.
*   **Hoisting**: "Unwraps" nested calls. `ta.ema(ta.sma(close, 10), 10)` is transformed into:
    1. Calculate SMA -> temp var.
    2. Calculate EMA using temp var.
    This simplifies the generated code and ensures proper order of operations for stateful functions.
*   **Lazy operands (no hoisting)**: Pine evaluates `?:` branches lazily in every version, and the right operand of `and` / `or` lazily from v6 (v5 is strict). Hoisting a call out of such a position would run it unconditionally — `size(a) > 0 ? array.get(a, 0) : na` would throw on an empty array, and a `ta.*` call in an untaken branch would execute on every bar. `analysis/LazyOperandPass.ts` tags nodes in lazy positions with `_lazyOperand`; `transformCallExpression` then keeps those calls inline (hoisting suppressed for the call and its arguments) and the expression walkers stop descending into them (`isInlinedLazyCall`). Built-in TA *variables* (`ta.tr`, `ta.obv`, …) are the exception and are still hoisted to the script body via `addOuterHoistedStatement`, because they must run on every bar regardless of position. `request.*` calls are the other exception: TradingView computes the requested expression on every bar of the other context whatever chart-side condition wraps the call, so they stay hoisted (a ternary *inside* the requested expression is still lazy). For Pine v5 sources an `and` / `or` that sits inside a lazy branch is tagged `_strictLogical` and lowered by `transformStrictLogicalOperators` to `$.pine.math.__and` / `__or`, so both operands are still evaluated (v5 strictness) but only when the branch is taken.
